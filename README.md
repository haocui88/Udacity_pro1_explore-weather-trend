# Udacity_pro1_explore-weather-trend
This is a project from Udacity data analyst nanodegree program.


## Introduction
I compared the temperature trends of Raleigh, North Carolina with the global temperature trends. I extracted and downloaded the csv data by using SQL query and analyzed the data by using Jupyter notebook with python 3.6. Overall, I find both global and local temperature has been increasing from the time period I analyzed (1750-2013) and there is an obvious increase trends especially after 1850(the start of the 2nd industry revolution).  






## Step
* Step1: I extracted and downloaded the data of both global and local temperature by using SQL query statements
* Step2: I use the Jupyter Notebook to read and import the downloaded csv data.
* Step3: Explore the data to understand the data structure of the data frame. 
* Step4: Wrangling the data for future analysis
* Step5: Moving average the trend to find the pattern of the weather
* Step6: Data visuliaztion and find the pattern






## Project deliverables
The final analysis will take the form of a PDF document which contains a plot of the data, analysis of said plot and outlines the steps taken:
>* An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart
>* What tools did I use for the project
>* How did I calculate the moving average?
>* What were my key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?
>* Line chart with local and global temperature trends
>* Five observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends
